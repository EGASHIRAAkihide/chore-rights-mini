# ChoreRights UAT (User Acceptance Testing) & Sign-Off Report

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-10-16  
**Owner:** Product Management Office (PMO)

---

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this User Acceptance Testing (UAT) phase is to confirm that the **ChoreRights MVP** — developed as part of the Proof of Concept (PoC) — meets the agreed functional, legal, and user experience requirements.

The UAT serves as the **final quality gate** before public release and investor demonstration.  
This document captures the **scope, participants, procedures, results, and approval signatures** for UAT completion.

---

## 2. Objectives

- Verify that all **core business flows** work end-to-end from a user perspective.
- Ensure that the **PoC prototype is stable, usable, and aligned** with business and legal goals.
- Confirm that **stakeholders (creators, companies, legal advisors)** approve the MVP’s functionality.
- Identify any residual issues and define actions before full-scale release.
